1. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page. 

2. To select a dom element by its id we can use document.getElementbyID(...). 

3. If you add HTML to a page using innerHTML (or several jQuery methods), you need to be aware of Cross-Site Scripting Attacks or CCS; 
otherwise, an attacker could gain access to your users' accounts.

4. HTML events are actions that happen to HTML elements. 

5. Event Listeners are a more recent approach to handling events. They can deal with more than one function at a time

<html>

    <body>

        <div id = "first-div" onclick = "replaceTxt()">initial text</div>

    </body>


    <script>

        function replaceTxt()
        {
            const firstDiv = document.getElementById('first-div');
            firstDiv.textContent = 'added text!';
            firstDiv.style.backgroundColor = 'lightyellow';

        }
